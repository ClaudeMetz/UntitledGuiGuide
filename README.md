# Untitled GUI Guide

This project aims to teach you about building custom interfaces in [Factorio](https://factorio.com). It does so in two parts: First, a chapterized tutorial that guides you through the process, starting at the very basics of element creation and interaction handling. Second, it provides a loose collection of advanced topics that you can use to expand your knowledge.

**The actual tutorial is found in this project's [Wiki](https://github.com/ClaudeMetz/UntitledGuiGuide/wiki)!**
